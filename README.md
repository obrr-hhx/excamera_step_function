# excamera_step_function

This is a very simple example for excamera built by aws step function.

## Work Flow

The excamera work flow is referenced from the Makefile which is generated by gen_makefile.py.

To know more about the gen_makefile.py, click [here](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/gg/tree/master/examples/excamera).

This example uses four y4m files to execute the state machine, you can also get the y4m file from the link mentioned above.

what should be input to the state machine when executing is the input.json file. It just contains the s3 bucket name and your y4m file name.

## Log

The Log.py generates a unique name for the log file when correlative lambda function is executing and records the time of downloading the y4m file, executing and uploading. It also writes down the name and size of each download and upload file.

At the last of the log file, the command executed in the lambda function will be put.

The log file will be stored in your s3 bucket which path's prefix is log/.
